> [Graham scan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_scan), an algorithm for the [convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) of a two-dimensional system of points. A convex hull of a subset of the input is maintained in a stack, which is used to find and remove concavities(凹陷) in the boundary when a new point is added to the hull.
