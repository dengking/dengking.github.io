If you want to get in touch,drop me an email(2238897886 @qq .com). I write in Chinese and English, but it takes more time to write in English because of lacking practice. As an software engineer, I insist on studying theories in computer science and software engineering and try to have a clear and comprehensive picture of theories of specific field in computer science and software engineering , because I think the theory can guide engineer in application. I like reading, below are some book that I think useful to an software engineer Book Author Introduction to Automata and Language Theory(aka Cinderella Book ) Jeffrey D. Ullman , John E. Hopcroft Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (aka \"The Dragon Book\") Jeffrey D. Ullman , Alfred V. Aho Foundations of Computer Science/C Edition Jeffrey D.
