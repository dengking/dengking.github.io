# [Turing machine](https://www.euston96.com/en/turing-machine/)

The **Turing machine** is a **computer device** which consists of a **read** and **write header**, what we know best today as a **scanner** and a paper ribbon that passes through the machine. This tape was divided into **squares**, and each of them had a **symbol** at the same time. It was responsible for the **storage** of the machine and was a kind of vehicle for **entry** and **exit**, as well as working memory to store the results of the intermediate steps of the calculation.

## What is the Turing machine?

It is a more general language **recognition** **module** that any **Finite** and **Stack** automaton has, as it has the ability to recognize **regular** and context-**independent** languages, as well as many other types of languages.

## Features of Turing Machine

The main features of the Turing machine were as follows:

- The input that the tape has before the calculation begins, must consist of a finite number of symbols.
- The machine tape has an unlimited length.
- The read/write head can be programmable.
- The Turing machine is capable of doing six types of fundamental operations: read, write, move left, move right, change state and stop.
- It has the ability to compute anything any modern computer can calculate.
- It consists of an input and output alphabet and a special symbol called white.

## History of Turing machine

**Alan Mathison Turing** was the inventor of the Turing machine. He was known as an extremely talented man, who had great influences on the development of **computing** and on the formalization of the concept of **algorithm** and **computation** through his Turing machine, which played a very important role in the creation of the modern computer.

Turing described it for the first time in his 1936 article dealing with issues concerning **computable** **numbers**. In his article, Turing imagines that his creation is not a mechanical machine, but rather a person he decided to call a computer, which carelessly executes these deterministic mechanical rules.
