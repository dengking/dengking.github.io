# About me

Hi, I'm a software engineer living in Hangzhou,China. If you want to get in touch,drop me an email(2238897886@qq.com).

I write in Chinese and English, but it takes more time to write in English because of lacking practice.

As an software engineer, I insist on studying theories in [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) and [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering) and try to get a clear and comprehensive picture of theories of specific field in  [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) and [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering), because I think the theory can guide engineer in practice.

I like reading, below are some book that I think useful to an software engineer.
